pySerial 
s = serial.Serial('COMxx')
s.read()
s.write(b'xFF\x00\x01') # FF = device on, x00 = doesn't matter, x01 = pixel 1 on

the x01 corresponds to the relay pixel to turn on
01= 1
02 = 2
04 = 3
08 = 4
10 = 5
20 = 6
40 = 7
80 = 8

the "\x" is a unicode flag and the b'' in front means it's reading as bytes. So it's sending actual byte-strings to the USB relay
